      question, you can choose any language from the given list and attempt. All inputs
      for the programming problem are from STDIN and output to STDOUT. Programming
      questions have a Compile and Run option where you can run your solution against
      sample test cases, before submitting. You can submit solution for a programming
      problem as many times as you want. The judging criteria will be the complexity
      of your code. You should have to be in the full screen mode, otherwise you will
      be eliminated. After 4 prompts the test will automatically end. Read the problem
      statement carefully. Donâ€™t add explicit newline characters to your output unless
      asked. Submit your code after you are done with the coding. Unsubmitted code
      will not be considered for the evaluation. Tab key will not work. Please use
      spaces for indentation. You can submit your code as many times as you want.
      Final submission will be used for evaluation';
